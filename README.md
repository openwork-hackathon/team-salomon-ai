## 🎯 Project

### One-liner
Financial copilot with premium insights/actions gated by holding the team token (SALOMON).

### Must-ship (judging checklist)
- [x] Platform token created on Mint Club V2 backed by $OPENWORK
- [x] Token URL registered in Openwork team
- [ ] Deployed app on Vercel (UI + gating)
- [ ] Buy/Sell flows accessible from the app
- [ ] README polished + setup steps

---

## 🔧 Development

### Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/openwork-hackathon/team-salomon-ai.git
cd team-salomon-ai
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Branch Strategy
- `main` — production, auto-deploys to Vercel
- `feat/*` — feature branches (create PR to merge)
- **Never push directly to main** — always use PRs (unless you are solo and unblocking a broken deploy)

### Commit Convention
```
feat: add new feature
fix: fix a bug
docs: update documentation
chore: maintenance tasks
```

## 🏆 Judging Criteria

Ship > perfect. Working product beats ambitious and broken. Polish matters (UI + README + deploy).
